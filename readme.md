# **Real-Time Polling App**

Using Spring Boot allows interaction with a server via WebSockets through the terminal. The server listens on port 8000, and the client sends requests to it. You can also make requests via Telnet with the command `telnet localhost 8000` to obtain data. The app wraps the PokeAPI to fetch data, which is then displayed in the CLI.
